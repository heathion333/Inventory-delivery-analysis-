# Inventory Delivery Analysis Dashboard

##  Overview
This project analyzes inventory turnover, delivery delays, and warehouse fulfillment performance using Python. It merges three datasets—inventory, orders, and fulfillment—to uncover operational insights across the supply chain.

##  Key Insights
- **Inventory Turnover**: Highlights fast-moving vs slow-moving products
- **Delivery Delays**: Identifies shipment bottlenecks by product, region, and mode
- **Fulfillment Accuracy**: Compares scheduled vs actual delivery times across warehouses

##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data cleaning, merging, and visualization

##  Business Impact
This dashboard supports smarter inventory planning, fulfillment optimization, and customer experience improvements. It’s designed for supply chain analysts, operations managers, and logistics teams.

##  Data Sources
- `inventory.csv`: Warehouse inventory and cost data
- `orders_and_shipments.csv`: Order-level shipment details
- `fulfillment.csv`: Warehouse fulfillment cycle times

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `inventory_delivery_dashboard.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to generate insights and visualizations
